## Key Characteristics

- **Statically typed** - Type checking at compile time
- **Compiled** - Compiles directly to machine code for efficient execution
- **Garbage-collected** - Automatic memory management
- **Concurrent by design** - Built-in support for concurrent programming
- **Simple and readable** - Minimalist syntax with few keywords (~25)

## Core Design Philosophy

> "Do more with less"

- **Simplicity** - Easy to learn, read, and maintain
- **Pragmatism** - Focused on solving real-world problems
- **Efficiency** - Fast compilation and execution
- **Safety** - Memory safety and type safety

---

## Key Language Features

- **Goroutines** - Lightweight threads for concurrent execution
- **Channels** - Communication pipes between goroutines
- **Interfaces** - Implicit implementation for flexible code
- **Defer** - Simplified resource cleanup
- **Error handling** - Explicit error checking
- **Built-in testing** - Testing framework in standard library
- **Generics** - Compile-time polymorphism

## Standard Library

Go comes with a rich standard library that includes:

- HTTP servers and clients
- JSON/XML processing
- File I/O
- Cryptography
- Compression
- Testing frameworks
- And much more...

## Tooling

Go provides excellent development tools:

- `go build` - Compile packages and dependencies
- `go run` - Compile and run Go program
- `go test` - Run tests
- `go fmt` - Format source code
- `go mod` - Dependency management
- `go doc` - Documentation tool
